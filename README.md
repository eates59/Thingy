# Thingy
An utility application, sort of swiss army knife for my daily tasks

A Small and Handy application that I develop mainly to automate some of my tasks and make my life easier. Features include:

* Todo list
* Folder links
* Command line

Project is developed using C# and Visual Studio 2017 Community edition. Primary OS target is Windows 10, but should work on Windows 7/8

The project targets the .NET Framework 4.7, mainly because of the new & faster WPF renderer. (Probably not needed, but I like to use new technologies)
