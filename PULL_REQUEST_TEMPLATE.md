Pull requests are welcome, but they must meet the following constraints, before accepting:

# Pull request documentation
* Describe what the change does as best you can.
* Request must not break build. Only compileable changes will be merged

# Code quality and Architecture

My prefered settings: https://www.codeproject.com/Tips/1212669/Formating-XAML-for-Readability
* Use the MVVM pattern
* Use the Dependency Ijection pattern
* Code language is English for variable, method and other namings
